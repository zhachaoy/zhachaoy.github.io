# Devops

This is a [demo](wiki/Demo.md) of git-wiki theme for jekyll.

it's a full featured wiki powered by git, github pages and pull-requests!

It means: 

* Improvements in the cooperative aspect: forks, pull-requests and roles.
* You can customize your wiki as you want with style sheets and even changing the layout.
* No databases! Only static files that can be downloaded in a few seconds.
* Markdown and html mixed together!
* History, revision comparison and everything you need from a wiki platform.
* You can edit your pages with the standard git editor, prose.io (integrated) or any kind of editor you prefer.
* Non-existent wiki page links are "[red](wiki/red.md)"

You can fork/copy the master branch now and start your wiki in just 1 minute.

**Note:**
You can even include the github wiki as a submodule and enable the conf, but it's an experimental feature and it implies less advantages and greater disadvantages for now.

## Basic Build

We suggest the creation of a /wiki/ subfolder that collects all your .md pages (except index.md)

## Container
